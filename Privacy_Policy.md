### Android app _Awesome OCR_

Welcome to the Awesome OCR app for Android!

This is an Android app developed by Nicolò Cosimo Albanese and available on Google Play.

The app extracts text from images:

Therefore, a user may choose to take a picture from the camera to extract textual information.

The app does not collect any personally identifiable information.

The only processed data is camera photos. They are processed by the device only. No third party tool is involved, and no external call is performed by the app.

Moreover, before accessing the camera from app, the user is asked for consent in a clear manner. If consent is not given, the app will not access the camera:

The processing involves extracting text present in input images. The text can be exported by the user from the app to the clipboard. The app does not store the text identified in input images.

For any question or vulnerability that may have been inadvertently caused by me, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,

Nicolò Cosimo Albanese.

Milano, Italy.
